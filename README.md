# Smart IoT Water Tank System for Agriculture

## Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and planning of an IoT-based smart water tank system to optimize irrigation and manage water efficiently in agriculture.

The repository contains system diagrams, proposal documents, progress reports, and presentation materials developed as part of an academic group project at SLIIT.

> ⚠️ Note: Source code is not included in this repository as the project focused on system design, architecture, and implementation planning.
